            <p>

                to validate your user input without having to use JavaScript.

                "John" and the last name should have a default value of "Doe". You can create this using the 
                value attribute.

            <p>
                In the section with an id of answers, create a form with an id and name of form7. Ask the user
                for all the HTML files of the current website they are on. You can ask for a file with a file
                input, but you will need to use the multiple attribute to allow multiple files to be selected.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the section with an id of answers, create a form with an id and name of form8. Ask the user

                to select a number between 0 and 100. You should accept input as a slider by creating a range element.
                You should set min and max attributes so that the lowest number is 0 and the highest number is 100. 
                You should set the step attribute as well so that they can only select numbers divisible by 2.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside the section with an id of answers, create a form with an id and name of form11. Ask the user
                to enter their first and last name again using text inputs. Instead of a submit button, use an 
                image input. Images need to use a width and height attribute. Use the image logo_ywca_32by32.png.
                It is a 32px by 32px square.
            </p>
            <p>

                choose from using a datalist element and at least 3 options. Make sure the <i>list</i> attribute of
                the input element is the same as the id of the datalist. Set the autocomplete attribute to on.
